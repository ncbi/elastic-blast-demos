# ElasticBLAST demos

This repository contains sample programs to demonstrate usage of ElasticBLAST.

### End-to-end ElasticBLAST search with a timeout

The shell script `submit-and-wait-for-results.sh` submits an ElasticBLAST search and waits for the search to finish with a timeout.

### Jupyter notebook

The Jupyter notebook `elastic-blast-rdrp.ipynb` illustrates how to use ElasticBLAST with a simple BLAST search and analysis of results.
